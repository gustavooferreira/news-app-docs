# API Specifications

The documentation of the APIs was created using OpenAPI (fka Swagger).

The specs are stored inside the `openapi` folder.

The view the spec, either use [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) and import the yaml files (one at a time).

Or just click the links below, which will redirect you directly to Swagger UI:
